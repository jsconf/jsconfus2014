  <h4>Bikes, Bikes, and More Bikes</h4>
  <p>A fleet of bikes will be available allowing you to trek around the property on approximately seven miles of bicycle trails that will take you to some of Amelia Island Plantation's points of interest such as Aury Island, Drummond Point Park and Walker's Landing.

  <h3>Tuesday May 27th, 2014</h3>
  <h4>Shuttles from Jacksonville International Airport to Amelia Island</h4>
  <p>Unless arriving by private jet or space craft, Amelia Island is quite remote and that is a very good thing for our purposes. Unfortunately it does make getting here a little complex, but to make it a little easier we will be providing shuttles from the airport on a schedule interval. Details will be out shortly as well as the times the shuttle will run after we have a rough manifest of when everyone is arriving.</p>

  <h4>The Docking Station Welcome Reception  6:00PM - 9:00PM</h4>
  <p>After a long day of travel, land at the beach for an evening welcome reception and social gathering. Meet old friends, make new friends, and enjoy the sand between your toes! We will have various things going on during this event including light appetizers and refreshments. We may have various rockets takeoffs throughout the evening, so your space helmet is completely optional.</p>

    <h4>NodeRockets Event<br/> 9:00AM - 6:00PM</h4>
    <p>3...2...1...BLAST OFF!!! Why stop with just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r346rRTFvR4">Earth</a>, it is time to take JS to outer space (well, more outer space than drones). Join us for the first ever NodeRockets event as we combine all the power of hobby rockets with all the geekery of node.js.

    <h4>NodeBoats Event<br/> 9:00AM - 6:00PM</h4>

Team up (or go solo) to hack a submarine or other nautical device using node.js to bring the seas under your control.
