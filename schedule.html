  <h4>Heroku's Bike-as-an-Awesome</h4>
  <p class="hidden-xs">A fleet of bikes will be available allowing you to trek around the property on approximately seven miles of bicycle trails that will take you to some of Amelia Island Resort's points of interest such as Aury Island, Drummond Point Park and Walker's Landing. Resort trail maps and bikes will be available at Amelia's Wheels, just pick one up when you need/want one and return it once you are done!</p>

  <h3>Tuesday May 27th, 2014</h3>
  <h4>Meteor Shuttles from Jacksonville International Airport to Amelia Island</h4>
  <p class="hidden-xs">Unless arriving by private jet or space craft, Amelia Island is quite remote and that is a very good thing for our purposes. Unfortunately it does make getting here a little complex, but to make it a little easier we will be providing shuttles from the airport on a schedule interval. Details for the shuttles and other modes of transportation to the venue are <a href="/getting-here.html">available here</a>.</p>

  <h4>The Microsoft Astronaut's Welcome Reception  6:00PM - 9:00PM</h4>

  <p class="hidden-xs">After a long day of travel, land at the beach for an evening welcome reception and social gathering. Meet old friends, make new friends, and enjoy the sand between your toes! We will have various things going on during this event including light appetizers and refreshments. We may have various rockets takeoffs throughout the evening, so your space helmet is completely optional.</p>



  <h3>Wednesday May 28th, 2014</h3>
  <h4>The Olark Significant Others Track - 10:30AM - 5:00PM</h4>

    <h4>Starry Night Campfire<br/> 9:00PM - 11:00PM</h4>
    <p class="hidden-xs">Whether you just need a break from the dinner or are looking for deep conversation, stop by the evening campfire located on the beach. Pull up some sand, roast a couple marshmallows, and enjoy the stars. Make plans with your fellow attendees for the next or plan your space mission to the moon and back!</p>


    <h3 id='cyoa'>Thursday May 29th, 2014 - Day of Activities</h3>


    <h4>NodeRockets Event</h4>
    <p class="hidden-xs">3...2...1...BLAST OFF!!! Why stop with just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r346rRTFvR4">Earth</a>, it is time to take JS to outer space (well, more outer space than drones). Join us for the first ever NodeRockets event as we combine all the power of hobby rockets with all the geekery of node.js. Sign up, flight control, as we take to the sky and break the altitude barrier WITH CODE! This is one of our newest events and will be from 9AM to 6PM.</p>

    <h4>NodeBoats Event</h4>
    <p class="hidden-xs">Take the mission of spreading JS to every corner of the world to its next logical conclusion, the water! Team up (or go solo) to hack a submarine or other nautical device using node.js to bring the seas under your control. This is one of our newest events and will require attire that can get wet (you will most likely need to rescue your boat at least once). This event will be from 9AM to 6PM.</p>


    <h4>NodeBots Event </h4>
    <p class="hidden-xs"><img class='img-responsive hidden-xs' src="/img/banner/nodebots.jpg" alt="developers gonna develop"/></p>
    <p class="hidden-xs">Team up (or go solo) to hack together Arduino based robots and program it all using just JavaScript! If you have no idea what an LED is or a resistor for that matter, have no fear - NodeBot experts will be readily available to help you hardware hack, solder, and 3D print your way to a full fledged NodeBot.</p>

    <h4>NodeCopter Event</h4>
    <p class="hidden-xs"><img class='img-responsive hidden-xs' src="/img/banner/drones.jpg" alt="drones gonna drone"/></p>
    <p class="hidden-xs">Team up (or go solo) to hack a quadcopter using node.js to make a flying robot do your bidding. The NodeCopter event originally launched at JSConf EU and now we take it to the next level at JSConf US. This event will be from 9AM to 6PM.</p>


    <h4>The Poolside</h4>
    <p class="hidden-xs"><img class='img-responsive hidden-xs' src="/img/banner/poolside.jpg" alt="Chillaxin'"/></p>
    <p class="hidden-xs">Want to be outside, but still need access to the internet? Come on down to the amazing pooldeck where you can get a nice cold drink, a bit of food, wifi, and, when too hot, jump in the pool or hot tub. Brand new, the pool is the gem of the entire resort - even if you are on other events, you have to stop by the pool for a bit. Who knows, you may even catch a repeat of synchronized.swimming.js.</p>

    <h4>The Beachside </h4>
    <p class="hidden-xs"><img class='img-responsive hidden-xs' src="/img/banner/beach.jpg" alt="Sand, ocean, fun"/></p>
    <p class="hidden-xs">Hot sun, warm sand, and incredible ocean water - come down to the beach where there will be chairs, cabanas, and umbrellas for you to enjoy. If you get restless, we will have various activities set up. Other such fun items (buckets, shovels, etc) will be available and ready for you to craft an epic sand castle or catch a wave!</p>


    <h4>Golf Tournament</h4>
    <p class="hidden-xs"><img class='img-responsive hidden-xs' src="/img/banner/golf.jpg" alt="FORE!!!"/></p>
    <p class="hidden-xs">Take advantage of the world-class Amelia Island golf course overlooking the ocean. The tournament will be organized into teams of four (4) with all teams playing scramble format (AKA best shot of team is taken). If you do not have a team in mind, you will be placed into a team. Golf attire will be required, collared shirts, no jeans. Club rentals are available for $65 or you can bring your own. </p>

    <h4>Segway tour of Amelia Island </h4>
<p class="hidden-xs"><img class='img-responsive hidden-xs' src="/img/banner/segway.jpg" alt="Two wheels for too much fun!"/></p>
    <p class="hidden-xs">Experience the natural surroundings of the entire Amelia Island Resort while enjoying the rare chance to ride a <a href="http://www.segway.com/">Segway</a>! The tour includes a full orientation and guide to introduce you to the island and show you the various sights. Tours last for 2 hours and bottled water will be provided to keep you hydrated.</p>

    <h4>The Amazing Scavenger Hunt </h4>
    <p class="hidden-xs"><img class='img-responsive hidden-xs' src="/img/banner/scavenger.jpg" alt="Working this hard has never been this fun!"/></p>
    <p class="hidden-xs">Our unique scavenger hunt involves decorating your island hopper (golf cart for four) and setting out to find various clues, brainteasers, and challenges all with the assistance of your smart phone. Be prepared for an epic time while racing to be the first to finish the hunt!</p>

    <h4>Kayaking down the Amelia River </h4>
    <p class="hidden-xs"><img class='img-responsive hidden-xs' src="/img/banner/kayak.jpg" alt="Working this hard has never been this fun!"/></p>
    <p class="hidden-xs">All guided kayak tours are beginner friendly and are planned with the tide, to ensure a fun, safe, and relaxing adventure. Average tours are 3 hours long - pre-trip instruction then about 2 hours of paddling with a break mid trip for a snack (and swim on most tours). Professional naturalists and guides guarantee to dazzle you with their charming personalities, extensive knowledge of the eco system, and share stories of local history.</p>


    <h4>Starry Night Campfire<br/>9:00PM - 11:00PM</h4>
    <p class="hidden-xs">Whether you just need a break from the dinner or are looking for deep conversation, stop by the evening campfire located on the beach.
