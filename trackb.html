    <div class='title'>Cylon.js: The JavaScript Evolution Of Open Source Robotics</div>
      The robotics revolution has already begun. You can even buy drones and robotic devices at local retail stores. Unfortunately, it has been too hard to develop code for robots, and nearly impossible to create solutions that integrate multiple different kind of devices.
      <br/>
      That is why we created <a href="http://cylonjs.com">Cylon.js</a>, a JavaScript framework for open source robotics &amp; the Internet of Things. Cylon.js makes it easy to write apps that communicate with many different kinds of hardware devices all at the same time. The time has come for the next generation of open source robotics, and Cylon.js is ready to help!

      The 10x programmer is a unicorn. We love to lionize the amount of dedication, time, and thought that goes into creating great software -- but we forget the very real cost it can entail, both emotionally and physically, on the programmer. Depression, RSI, burnout: these are all real issues facing our field.

      The performance of your web app is important. This you already know. But how do you know your web app is performing well for all of your users? Before you can even begin that analysis, you need a way to measure your web app's current performance. Out of the box tools provide us metrics, but most only provide an overall view. This case study of building the XFINITY X1 single-page web app will demonstrate what frontend performance data should you be gathering, how to gather it, and then what do with that data.

      Introducing RaveJS. Rave eliminates configuration, machinery, and complexity. Stop configuring and tweaking file watchers, minifiers, and transpilers just to get to a runnable app. Instead, go from zero to "hello world" in 30 seconds. In the next 30 seconds, easily add capabilities and frameworks to your application simply by installing *Rave Extensions* and *Rave Starter* packages from npm and Bower, the leading JavaScript package managers. Finally, install additional *Rave Extension* packages to apply your favorite build, deploy, and testing patterns.

    <div class='title'>Yield Ahead: Regenerator in Depth</div>
      The future of JavaScript is too exciting to put on hold while native implementations get around to supporting much-needed new features like classes, generator functions, and modules. This talk dives into the concepts and techniques involved in transforming these futuristic syntaxes into JavaScript-of-today, through the lens of Facebook's Regenerator project, which efficiently simulates ES6 generator functions (and soon async functions too!) using plain ES5. Listeners will come away from this talk with a deep understanding of Regenerator's implementation, and also (hopefully!) a headful of ideas for designing transformations of their own.

      At Social Tables, we believe in giving engineers a lot of responsibility when it comes to building new features. For instance, they  may talk directly to customers to figure out feature requirements, and have them design the UI themselves. But is this a good thing? I'll make the case that it can actually be a great way to collaborate with other teams inside your company and bring diversity of thought into an engineering organization. I'll also talk about some of the pitfalls we've run into.

    <div class='title'>Template Specialization with Express Apps</div>
      Template specialization is a way to dynamically switch the partials in your views based on the request/response context. This becomes vital for big corporations like Paypal since we have cases where parts of the views are customized based on locale, device, user profile based A/B tests etc.This idea was born out of the work we did to support template specialization with <a href="http://github.com/krakenjs">Krakenjs suite</a> - the open sourced bootstrapping framework from Paypal. However, the idea is general enough to be implemented directly with vanilla express apps. This talk will demo template specialization in express apps with dust templates. <a href="http://linkedin.github.io/dustjs/">Dust</a> is a powerful javascript template engine which works well with node.js, and also provides the hooks required to add this capability. Additionally, I will also go over the recipe to enable specialization for any template engine, provided the engine exposes the hooks to tap into the render work flow to do your magic!
